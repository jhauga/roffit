.SH NAME
testpage \- test input nroff man page for roffit testing
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B roffit
[\fI\,options\/\fR] < inputfile > outputfile
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B roffit
converts the \fIinputfile\fP to \fIoutputfile\fP. The \fIinputfile\fP must be
an nroff formatted man page, and the \fIoutputfile\fP will be an HTML
document.

(RFC 959) is FTP

but ARFC 959 is a fake

RFC3986 is URI syntax

Full inline urls with http, https, or ftp protocols are converted to 
html links. For example: 

https://curl.se/, ("https://curl.se/docs"), (https://daniel.haxx.se/projects/roffit/).

But when the url is in an example it is not converted into an html link..

.nf
   cmd -opt https://example.com 
.fi  

When the protocols are declared within punctuations, but have no domain they remain
as an <a> element with the href attribute removed. For example:

("http://"), (https://), and "ftp://"; are <a> elements, while unpunctuated
http:// or https:// or ftp:// are inline text within <p> element.

Additionally special character options will have anchor links.
So if an option similar to the one below is documented;
it will have an anchor and anchor link:

.IP "-?, --special-char"
Options with special characters will be included in anchors.
Such as this option with special character \fI\-?, \-\-special\-char\fP.

Also, we must support \fIstyle staring on one line
and ending on another
that may\fP be multiple lines off.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--bare"
The output HTML will not include any HTML, HEAD or BODY tags. Also note that
when this is selected, there will be no inlined CSS but you will have to
define the necessary classes yourself.

.IP "--mumbo"
Display version number and exit. Also see \fB--jumbo\fP. Word in bold.

.IP "--jumbo"
Cool option. See \fI--mumbo\fP. Word in italic.

.IP \-\-mandir=<dir>
Set a directory in which \fIroffit\fP will check for other man pages (in nroff
[name].[num] format) that this one refers to. If found, a <a href> link will
be made to that page with a html extension instead of the number. The file
name in the generated link will be prefixed by the dir given with
\fI\-\-hrefdir\fP.

This works for references specified as \fImanpage(3)\fP (within the emhpasis
foformatting) and in a plain \.BR section (often used in the SEE ALSO
section).

.IP \-\-hrefdir=<dir>
Specify a directory to prefix generated href links created with the \-\-mandir
option. This defaults to ".".

.SH "CSS CLASSES"
.IP h2.nroffsh
The nroff ".SH" section. These are normally the "headlines" before each sub
section within the man page.
.IP p.nroffip
The nroff ".IP" section. These are normally the bullet kind used to list each
option out of several in a list. Usually followed by a \fIp.level0\fP
containining the descriptive text.
.IP p.level0
Normal text at the first level. Normally not indented.
.IP p.level1
Text at next logical indent level. Normally indented one level right.
.IP p.level2
Text at the second logical indent level. Normally indented two levels right.
.IP span.bold
Text marked to be bold.
.IP span.manpage
Text marked as a reference to another man page.
.IP span.emphasis
Text marked to be emphasized.
.IP p.roffit
Used for advertising final paragraph.
